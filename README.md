# Food-Lab
The Culinary Randomizer
FoodLab is an interactive web application designed to solve the age-old question: "What should I eat today?" Instead of a simple text generator, FoodLab provides a gamified, visual experience that turns indecision into entertainment.

✨ Features
1. Synchronized Dual-Wheel Interface
Left Wheel (Cuisine): Users can drag and rotate the wheel to select their preferred cuisine (e.g., Korean, American, Chinese).

Right Wheel (Dishes): Automatically syncs with the selected cuisine to preview available dishes.

Drag & Snap: Implemented with intuitive drag-and-drop mechanics and auto-snapping logic for a tactile feel.

2. Physics-Based Transition Animation
Powered by Matter.js, this feature creates a dynamic transition between selection and result.

Real food images rain down from the top of the screen, colliding and piling up realistically, building anticipation before the final reveal.

3. Aesthetic Result Display
Receipt Style: The final result is presented as a restaurant order ticket, complete with a perforated edge design and pricing details.

Visual Appeal: Features high-quality, appetizing imagery on a classic red gingham tablecloth background.
